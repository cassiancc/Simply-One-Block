Simply One Block is an optimization modpack for 22w13oneblockatatime, the April Fools snapshot for the never-released [One Block at a Time Update](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/mojang-studios-release-new-astonishing-update).

## What is 22w13oneblockatatime?

22w13oneblockatatime is one of the yearly April Fools updates for Minecraft, in which your inventory has been entirely removed. Without your inventory, you'll have to get creative if you want to beat the game.

## How To Play - The Basics

<center><img width= 90% src="https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/1FPAqIE9/images/aca0c9959203e88482c4f17e22d2825b97ad2648.png"></center><br>

- This is one of the most dramatic departures from Vanilla Minecraft. Your inventory has been entirely removed, but your fists now have Silk Touch, hunger is nonexistent, and you can pick up Chickens and use them to fly as if you're playing Flappy Bird.
- **No Inventory?**: Anything you mine now appears directly in your hand. 
   - Chests can be left clicked to explode their contents out into the world.
   - Items are also now single use, so be careful what blocks you use that Pickaxe on.
- **No Combat?**: Attempting to left click on a mob instead picks the mob up.
  - When holding a skeleton, it will shoot wherever you're looking.
  - When holding a chicken, you can press Space to flap. You'll also fall slowly.
  - When holding a spider, you can climb up walls!

## How To Play - Crafting

- **What about Crafting?**: With the Crafting Menu removed, Crafting now takes place in the world. Find a Village or other structure with a Crafting Table. You can either set your recipe down on top of it and toss a Crafting Table on top of it, or throw the last item down. This is fairly finicky, and can take time to get right.

## How To Play - Getting to The Nether

- **How do I build a Nether Portal?**: Ruined Portals will be your friend here. Mining Obsidian with your fist is slow, but it's possible. Alternatively, you can craft a Pickaxe to speed up the process. If the nearest Portal is missing pieces, you can create Obsidian by picking up Seagrass to spread water.
- **But how do I light it?**: Nearby lava can set fire to nearby flammable blocks like Planks. The fire can then be picked up and placed on the Portal to light it. If the nearest portal is missing lava, you might be able to craft a Flint and Steel out of Iron from an Iron Golem and Flint from a Ruined Portal Chest.


## How To Play - Getting to The End

- **No Ender Eyes?**: Instead of Ender Eyes, End Portal Frames can be found in Nether Fortress chests. When placed in the Overworld, they'll point towards the nearest Stronghold. It's your goal to deliver these frames back to the Stronghold, as you're not likely to have a full portal.
- **How do I kill the Dragon?**: After destroying the towers (I'd recommend using a Chicken to fly to the tops of the towers and throwing blocks at them), you can wait for it to perch, and left click on it to ride it! Riding the Dragon is sufficient to open the End Portal, and grant the new `Ride the End` advancement.
